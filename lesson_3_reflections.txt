When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  	
	We would create a remote repository when we need to share our project on the web 
  	with others and also to enable others to contribute to the code and also to 		collaborate with others. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Pulling changes automatically may bring in code changes that we havenâ€™t worked on and thus may break the code that we had been working on before the pull.
